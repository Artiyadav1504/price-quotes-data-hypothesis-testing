# Price-quotes-data-hypothesis-testing

BACKGROUND: When an order is placed by a customer of a small manufacturing company, a price quote must be developed for that order. Because each order is unique, quotes must be established on an order-by-order basis by a pricing expert. The price quote process is labor intensive, as prices depend on many factors such as the part number, customer, geographic location, market, and order volume.
Presently, Two randomly selected pricing experts, Mary and Barry, were asked to independently provide prices for twelve randomly selected orders. Each expert provided one price for each of the twelve orders.

BUSINESS PROBLEM: We would like to assess if there is any difference in the average price quotes provided by Mary and Barry.
DATA AVAILABLE:
Price_Quotes.csv
The data set contains the order number, 1 through 12, and the price quotes by Mary and Barry for each order. Each row in the data set is the same order. Thus, Mary and Barry produced quotes for the same orders.
